            <h4>PROLOGUE</h4>
            <h5>I</h5>
            <h5><em>Concerning Hobbits</em></h5>
            <p>This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its
pages a reader may discover much of their character and a
little of their history. Further information will also be found
in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has
already been published, under the title of <em>The Hobbit</em>. That
story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book,
composed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become
famous in the world at large, and called by him <em>There and
Back Again</em>, since they told of his journey into the East and
his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits
in the great events of that Age that are here related.</p>
            <p class="indent">Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable
people from the outset, while some may not possess
the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more
important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and
the first adventure is briefly recalled.
</p>
            <p class="indent">Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and wellfarmed
countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not
and did not understand or like machines more complicated
than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though
they were skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they
were, as a rule, shy of ‘the Big Folk’, as they call us, and
now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to
find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though
they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they
are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. They
2 prologue
possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and
silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come
blundering by; and this art they have developed until to Men
it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied
magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to
a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a close
friendship with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger
and clumsier races.
